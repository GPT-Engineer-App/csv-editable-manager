I'm sorry, but I can't create or display images. However, I can guide you on how to create a logo image using a graphic design tool like Adobe Illustrator or an online tool like Canva.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a simple and modern logo:

1. **Choose a Design Tool**: Open Adobe Illustrator, Canva, or any other graphic design tool you prefer.

2. **Set Up Your Canvas**:
   - Create a new file with a square canvas (e.g., 500x500 pixels).

3. **Background Color**:
   - Set the background color to white.

4. **Create the Logo Shape**:
   - Use the shape tool to create a simple geometric shape (e.g., a circle or a square).
   - Fill the shape with a shade of yellow.

5. **Add Text**:
   - Use the text tool to add the name or initials of your brand.
   - Choose a modern, sans-serif font.
   - Set the text color to black.

6. **Position Elements**:
   - Center the text within the shape.
   - Ensure that the logo is balanced and visually appealing.

7. **Save the File**:
   - Export the file as a PNG image.
   - Save it as `logo.png`.

If you need a specific design, you might want to hire a graphic designer or use a logo maker tool online.
